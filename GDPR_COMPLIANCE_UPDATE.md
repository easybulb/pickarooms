## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Button State Logic (Step 4):**

```javascript
let pinReady = false; // Track PIN status

function updateButtonState() {
    if (pinReady && gdprCheckbox.checked) {
        confirmBtn.disabled = false; // ✅ Both conditions met
    } else {
        confirmBtn.disabled = true;  // ❌ One or both missing
    }
}

// Called when:
// 1. GDPR checkbox changes
// 2. PIN status updates (ready/failed/loading)
```

### **PIN Status Messages:**

| PIN Status | Message |
|------------|---------|
| ✅ Ready | "Your access PIN is ready! **Please accept the privacy terms below to continue.**" |
| ⏳ Loading | "Preparing your access PIN... Almost ready!" |
| ❌ Failed | "PIN generation failed. You will be redirected to contact support." |
