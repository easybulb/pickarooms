# Multi-Room Single Booking Detection - Implementation Complete

## Overview

This feature handles the scenario where a guest books multiple rooms for the same check-in date using a single booking reference. The system now:

1. **Auto-detects multi-room bookings** during email search
2. **Auto-enriches all rooms** with the same booking reference
3. **Sends confirmation SMS** to admin for verification
4. **Allows correction** if the enrichment was wrong (rare edge case)

## Problem Solved

### Scenario 1: TRUE COLLISION ✅ (Already Handled)
- **What happens:** 2+ bookings, 2+ emails (different booking refs)
- **System behavior:** SMS sent asking admin to assign each ref to correct room
- **Status:** Already working

### Scenario 2: MULTI-ROOM SINGLE BOOKING ✅ (NEW - Just Implemented)
- **What happens:** 2+ bookings, 1 email (one booking ref for multiple rooms)
- **System behavior:** Auto-enriches all rooms, sends confirmation SMS
- **Status:** **NOW WORKING** ✅

---

## Flow

### When Email Found and Multiple Unenriched Reservations Exist:

```
1. iCal sync creates 2 reservations (same check-in date)
   - Room 1 (20 Dec, 2 nights) - unenriched
   - Room 2 (20 Dec, 2 nights) - unenriched

2. Email search finds 1 email: "6588202211, 20 Dec 2025"

3. System detects multi-room scenario:
   - Counts unenriched reservations for same date: 2
   - Since count > 1, assumes multi-room booking

4. System auto-enriches ALL rooms:
   - Room 1: booking_reference = "6588202211"
   - Room 2: booking_reference = "6588202211"

5. System sends confirmation SMS:
   ```
   PickARooms Alert

   Multi-room booking detected:
   Check-in: 20 Dec 2025

   Enriched 2 rooms with ref:
   #6588202211

   Room 1 (2 nights)
   Room 2 (2 nights)

   ✅ Reply 'OK' to confirm
   ❌ Reply booking refs if wrong:

   Example (if wrong):
   6588202211: 1-2
   6717790453: 2-2
   ```
```

## Admin Responses

### Option 1: Everything Correct (Multi-Room Booking)

**Admin replies:**
```
OK
```

**System response:**
```
✅ CONFIRMED

Multi-room booking verified.
All rooms ready for check-in.
```

### Option 2: Wrong! It's Actually 2 Separate Bookings (Rare Edge Case)

**Admin replies (multi-line):**
```
6588202211: 1-2
6717790453: 2-2
```

**System behavior:**
1. Deletes wrong enrichment (6588202211 from Room 2)
2. Re-enriches correctly:
   - Room 1: 6588202211 (2 nights)
   - Room 2: 6717790453 (2 nights)
3. Sends confirmation

## The Rare Edge Case This Handles

**Timeline:**
```
12:00 - iCal sync: Room 1 booking (20 Dec) → triggers email search
12:05 - NEW booking: Room 2 (20 Dec) → iCal hasn't synced yet
12:10 - Email search finds 1 email (for Room 1 booking)
12:15 - iCal syncs again → NOW finds Room 2 booking
        → Email search already matched Room 1's email to BOTH rooms (wrong!)
```

**Probability:** Very low (requires booking within 15-min iCal sync window + 10-min email search window)

**Solution:** Admin gets SMS asking to confirm or correct. Simple!
