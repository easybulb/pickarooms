# MULTI-ROOM BOOKING - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## ‚úÖ PHASE 1: DATABASE SCHEMA (COMPLETED)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Done
- Changed `Reservation.guest` from `OneToOneField` to `ForeignKey`
- Updated `Guest.is_ical_guest()` method
- Updated `Guest._get_message_context()` method
- Migration created and applied locally

---

## üöß PHASE 2: MULTI-ROOM CHECK-IN LOGIC (TO DO)

### A. Guest Web Check-In Flow (`enrich_reservation`)

**Current Issue:**
- Guest enters booking ref ‚Üí Finds multiple reservations
- Creates 1 Guest but only links to 1 reservation
- Other rooms remain unenriched

**Required Changes:**
1. Detect if multiple reservations exist with same booking reference
2. Create 1 Guest record
3. Link ALL reservations to that single Guest
4. Generate PINs for ALL rooms (front door + each room)

**File:** `main/views.py` - line ~392

```python
def enrich_reservation(request):
    # ... existing validation ...
    
    # NEW: Check for multi-room booking
    all_reservations = Reservation.objects.filter(
        booking_reference=reservation.booking_reference,
        status='confirmed',
        guest__isnull=True  # Only unenriched
    )
    
    # Create guest
    guest = Guest.objects.create(...)
    
    # Link ALL reservations to guest
    for res in all_reservations:
        res.guest = guest
        res.save()
    
    # Generate PINs for ALL rooms
    # - Front door (1 PIN shared)
    # - Room 1 door
    # - Room 2 door
    # etc.
```

---

### B. Admin Manual Check-In (`manual_checkin_reservation`)

**Current Issue:**
- Admin clicks "Check In" on Room 1 ‚Üí Guest created ‚úÖ
- Admin clicks "Check In" on Room 2 ‚Üí DATABASE ERROR ‚ùå (fixed by schema change)
- But Room 2 PIN not generated, not linked to existing guest

**Required Changes:**
1. Check if Guest with same booking_reference already exists
2. If YES ‚Üí Link reservation to existing guest, generate PIN for new room only
3. If NO ‚Üí Create new guest, check for other reservations with same booking ref, generate PINs for all

**File:** `main/views.py` - line ~1746

```python
def manual_checkin_reservation(request, reservation_id):
    reservation = get_object_or_404(Reservation, id=reservation_id)
    
    # NEW: Check if Guest already exists with this booking reference
    existing_guest = Guest.objects.filter(
        reservation_number=reservation.booking_reference
    ).first()
    
    if existing_guest:
        # Link reservation to existing guest
        reservation.guest = existing_guest
        reservation.save()
        
        # Generate PIN for this room ONLY (front door already has PIN)
        # Add room lock PIN for the new room
        
        messages.success(request, f"Linked to existing guest {existing_guest.full_name}. Generated PIN for {reservation.room.name}")
        return redirect('admin_page')
    
    # Create new guest
    guest = Guest.objects.create(...)
    
    # NEW: Check for other reservations with same booking ref
    other_reservations = Reservation.objects.filter(
        booking_reference=reservation.booking_reference,
        status='confirmed',
        guest__isnull=True
    ).exclude(id=reservation.id)
    
    # Link ALL to same guest
    reservation.guest = guest
    reservation.save()
    
    for other_res in other_reservations:
        other_res.guest = guest
        other_res.save()
    
    # Generate PINs for ALL rooms
    # - Front door (1 shared PIN)
    # - Each room door
```

---

### C. SMS Collision Resolution (`handle_multi_collision_enrichment`)

**Current Status:** Partially implemented (yesterday's work)

**File:** `main/services/sms_commands.py`

**Required Verification:**
- Ensure it creates 1 Guest (not multiple)
- Links all reservations to that 1 Guest
- Generates PINs for all rooms

---

## üöß PHASE 3: MULTI-ROOM PIN GENERATION (TO DO)

### Current Issue:
- System only generates 1 front door PIN + 1 room door PIN
- Multi-room guests need: Front door + Room 1 + Room 2 + Room 3...

### Solution:
Create helper function `generate_multiroom_pins(guest, reservations_list)`

**File:** `main/views.py` or new `main/pin_multi_room_utils.py`

```python
def generate_multiroom_pins(guest, reservations):
    """
    Generate PINs for multi-room bookings
    - 1 front door PIN (shared across all rooms)
    - 1 PIN per room door
    
    Returns: dict with room_id ‚Üí pin_id mapping
    """
    front_door_lock = TTLock.objects.get(is_front_door=True)
    pin = generate_memorable_4digit_pin()  # Same PIN for all
    
    uk_timezone = pytz.timezone("Europe/London")
    now_uk_time = timezone.now().astimezone(uk_timezone)
    start_time = int(now_uk_time.timestamp() * 1000)
    
    # Use latest check-out date from all reservations
    latest_checkout = max([r.check_out_date for r in reservations])
    check_out_time = guest.late_checkout_time or time(11, 0)
    end_date = uk_timezone.localize(
        datetime.datetime.combine(latest_checkout, check_out_time)
    ) + timedelta(days=1)
    end_time = int(end_date.timestamp() * 1000)
    
    ttlock_client = TTLockClient()
    room_pin_ids = {}
    
    # Generate front door PIN
    front_door_response = ttlock_client.generate_temporary_pin(
        lock_id=front_door_lock.lock_id,
        pin=pin,
        start_time=start_time,
        end_time=end_time,
        name=f"Front Door - Multi-Room - {guest.full_name} - {pin}"
    )
    
    guest.front_door_pin = pin
    guest.front_door_pin_id = front_door_response["keyboardPwdId"]
    
    # Generate PIN for each room
    for reservation in reservations:
        room_lock = reservation.room.ttlock
        if room_lock:
            room_response = ttlock_client.generate_temporary_pin(
                lock_id=room_lock.lock_id,
                pin=pin,
                start_time=start_time,
                end_time=end_time,
                name=f"Room - {reservation.room.name} - {guest.full_name} - {pin}"
            )
            room_pin_ids[reservation.room.id] = room_response["keyboardPwdId"]
    
    guest.save()
    return room_pin_ids
```

## üöß PHASE 4: ROOM_DETAIL PAGE UPDATES (TO DO)

### Current Issue:
- room_detail.html only shows 1 room
- Multi-room guests need to see ALL their rooms

### Required Changes:

**File:** `main/views.py` - `room_detail` function

```python
def room_detail(request, room_token):
    guest = Guest.objects.filter(secure_token=room_token).first()
    
    # NEW: Get all reservations for this guest (multi-room)
    guest_reservations = guest.reservations.all()  # Now works because of ForeignKey
    
    # Build list of rooms guest has access to
    guest_rooms = [
        {
            'room': res.room,
            'check_in': res.check_in_date,
            'check_out': res.check_out_date,
            'booking_ref': res.booking_reference,
        }
        for res in guest_reservations
    ]
    
    context = {
        'guest': guest,
        'primary_room': guest.assigned_room,  # Main room (for backward compatibility)
        'guest_rooms': guest_rooms,  # NEW: All rooms
        'is_multiroom': len(guest_rooms) > 1,  # NEW: Flag
        # ... existing context ...
    }
```

**File:** `main/templates/main/room_detail.html`

Add section after PIN display:

```html
{% if is_multiroom %}
<div class="multi-room-section">
    <h2>üè† Your Rooms</h2>
    <p>You have access to multiple rooms:</p>
    <div class="rooms-grid">
        {% for room_info in guest_rooms %}
        <div class="room-card">
            <h3>{{ room_info.room.name }}</h3>
            <p>Check-in: {{ room_info.check_in|date:"d M Y" }}</p>
            <p>Check-out: {{ room_info.check_out|date:"d M Y" }}</p>
            <button class="btn-unlock" onclick="unlockRoom('{{ room_info.room.id }}')">
                üîì Unlock {{ room_info.room.name }}
            </button>
        </div>
        {% endfor %}
    </div>
    <p class="pin-note">‚úÖ Your PIN works for all rooms: {{ front_door_pin }}</p>
</div>
{% endif %}
```

Add unlock functionality for specific rooms:

```javascript
function unlockRoom(roomId) {
    // Similar to existing unlock logic but targets specific room
    fetch(window.location.href, {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData,
        headers: {'X-CSRFToken': csrfToken}
    })
    // ...
}
```

---

## üöß PHASE 5: ADMIN DASHBOARD UPDATES (TO DO)

### Current Issue:
- Dashboard shows each reservation separately
- Multi-room bookings not visually grouped

### Required Enhancement:

**File:** `main/templates/main/admin_page.html` or `all_reservations.html`

Add visual indicator for multi-room bookings:

```html
{% if entry.is_multiroom %}
<span class="badge multi-room-badge">
    üè† Multi-Room ({{ entry.room_count }} rooms)
</span>
{% endif %}
```

**File:** `main/views.py` - `admin_page` function

Add multi-room detection:

```python
# When building todays_entries and current_entries
for entry in entries:
    if entry['type'] == 'guest':
        # Check how many reservations this guest has
        room_count = entry['object'].reservations.count()
        entry['is_multiroom'] = room_count > 1
        entry['room_count'] = room_count
```

## üìã TESTING CHECKLIST

### Test Scenario 1: Guest Web Check-In (Multi-Room)
- [ ] Create 2 reservations: same booking ref, same check-in date, different rooms
- [ ] Guest enters booking ref via web
- [ ] System creates 1 Guest
- [ ] System links BOTH reservations to Guest
- [ ] System generates front door PIN (1)
- [ ] System generates Room 1 PIN
- [ ] System generates Room 2 PIN
- [ ] room_detail page shows BOTH rooms
- [ ] Guest can unlock BOTH room doors remotely

### Test Scenario 2: Admin Manual Check-In (Sequential)
- [ ] Create 2 reservations: same booking ref, same date, different rooms
- [ ] Admin clicks "Check In" on Room 1
- [ ] Guest created, PIN generated for Room 1
- [ ] Admin clicks "Check In" on Room 2
- [ ] System detects existing guest
- [ ] Links Room 2 to same guest (no error!)
- [ ] Generates PIN for Room 2 door
- [ ] Verify: Both reservations point to same Guest ID
- [ ] Verify: Guest has PINs for front door + Room 1 + Room 2

### Test Scenario 3: Admin Manual Check-In (All at Once)
- [ ] Create 3 reservations: same booking ref, same date
- [ ] Admin clicks "Check In" on any one
- [ ] System detects other unenriched reservations with same ref
- [ ] Creates 1 Guest
- [ ] Links ALL 3 reservations to Guest
- [ ] Generates PINs for front door + all 3 rooms

### Test Scenario 4: SMS Collision Resolution
- [ ] Create 2 reservations: same check-in date
- [ ] Admin replies with multi-line SMS:
   ```
   1234567890: 1-2
   1234567890: 2-2
   ```
- [ ] System creates 1 Guest
- [ ] Links BOTH reservations
- [ ] Generates PINs for both rooms

### Test Scenario 5: room_detail Page Display
- [ ] Guest with 2 rooms checks in
- [ ] Opens room_detail page
- [ ] Sees "Your Rooms" section
