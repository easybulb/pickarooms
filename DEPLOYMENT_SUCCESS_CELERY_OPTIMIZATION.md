# ✅ Celery Optimization - Successfully Deployed!

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED AND RUNNING**

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Your Celery worker optimization has been successfully deployed to Heroku!

### Current Dyno Status:
```
✅ beat.1   - UP (4s ago) - Celery Beat Scheduler
✅ web.1    - UP (31s ago) - Gunicorn Web Server
✅ worker.1 - UP (31s ago) - Celery Worker (concurrency=2)
```

## 📊 Changes Deployed

### 1. **Process Separation** ✅
- **Before**: 1 dyno running both beat + worker
- **After**: 2 separate dynos (beat + worker)

### 2. **Task Frequency Reduction** ✅
| Task | Before | After | Reduction |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Email polling | Every 2 min | Every 5 min | **60% less** |
| iCal polling | Every 10 min | Every 15 min | **33% less** |
| Total tasks/day | ~900 | ~400 | **55% reduction** |

### 3. **Worker Configuration** ✅
```bash
# Old
worker: celery -A pickarooms worker --beat --loglevel=info

# New
worker: celery -A pickarooms worker --loglevel=info --concurrency=2 --max-tasks-per-child=100
beat: celery -A pickarooms beat --loglevel=info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler
```

### 4. **Task Limits Added** ✅
- ⏱️ Task time limit: 5 minutes (hard), 4 minutes (soft)
- 🔄 Worker restarts: After 100 tasks (prevents memory leaks)
- 🚫 Rate limiting: 10/min for syncs, 5/min for alerts
- ⏰ Task expiration: All tasks expire if not picked up

### 5. **Worker Settings** ✅
- 🎯 Prefetch: 1 task at a time (no queue buildup)
- ✅ Acks late: Only acknowledge after completion
- 🛑 Reject on crash: Reject tasks if worker dies
- 🔀 Concurrency: 2 parallel tasks

## 📈 Expected Results

### Before Optimization:
- ❌ Worker CPU: 100%+ (overloaded)
- ❌ Tasks cascading infinitely
- ❌ Beat + Worker in same process
- ❌ No rate limiting
- ❌ Tasks running every 2 minutes

### After Optimization:
- ✅ Worker CPU: **30-50%** (healthy)
- ✅ Tasks rate limited and controlled
- ✅ Beat + Worker separated
- ✅ Rate limiting: 10/min syncs, 5/min alerts
- ✅ Tasks running every 5-15 minutes

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check Worker Performance:
```bash
# Real-time logs
heroku logs --tail -a pickarooms

# Worker-specific logs
heroku logs --tail --source app/worker -a pickarooms

# Beat-specific logs
heroku logs --tail --source app/beat -a pickarooms

# Check dyno status
heroku ps -a pickarooms
```

### Check Metrics (after 1 hour):
1. Go to Heroku Dashboard → pickarooms → Metrics
2. Look for:
   - Worker CPU: Should be 30-50% (was 100%+)
   - Beat CPU: Should be <10%
   - Memory: Should be stable
   - No task queue buildup

## ⚠️ What to Watch For

### Good Signs ✅
- Worker CPU stays 30-50%
- Beat CPU stays <10%
- Tasks complete successfully
- No "Task exceeded time limit" errors
- Logs show tasks running at scheduled times

### Warning Signs ⚠️
- Worker CPU still >80%
- Many "rate limit exceeded" errors
- Tasks timing out
- Queue size growing

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If worker CPU is still high:
```bash
# Reduce worker concurrency to 1
heroku ps:scale worker=1:basic -a pickarooms

# Or increase polling intervals further
# Edit pickarooms/settings.py:
# EMAIL_POLL_INTERVAL: 300 → 600 (10 min)
# ICAL_POLL_INTERVAL: 900 → 1800 (30 min)
```

### If tasks are getting throttled:
```bash
# Check logs for "rate limit exceeded"
heroku logs --tail -a pickarooms | grep "rate limit"

# Increase rate limits in main/tasks.py
# @shared_task(rate_limit='10/m') → @shared_task(rate_limit='20/m')
```

### If you need to clear the task queue:
```bash
# Clear Redis queue
heroku redis:cli -a pickarooms
>>> FLUSHALL
>>> exit
```

### If you need to restart everything:
```bash
heroku restart -a pickarooms
```

## 💰 Cost Impact

### Monthly Cost:
- **Before**: 1 worker dyno = $7/month (Basic)
- **After**: 1 worker + 1 beat = $14/month (Basic)
- **Increase**: ~$7/month

**Is it worth it?** ✅ YES!
- Proper separation of concerns
- More stable and maintainable
- No more 100% CPU overload
- Better monitoring and scaling

## 📝 Files Changed

1. ✅ **Procfile** - Separated beat from worker
2. ✅ **pickarooms/settings.py** - Consolidated schedules + added limits
3. ✅ **pickarooms/celery.py** - Removed duplicate schedule
4. ✅ **main/tasks.py** - Added rate limiting to all tasks
5. ✅ **main/enrichment_config.py** - Updated polling interval

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Done ✅):
- [x] Pushed to GitHub main
- [x] Pushed to Heroku main
- [x] Scaled beat dyno to 1
- [x] All dynos running successfully

### Monitor (Next 24 hours):
- [ ] Check worker CPU usage (should be 30-50%)
- [ ] Check beat CPU usage (should be <10%)
- [ ] Verify tasks running at correct intervals
- [ ] Check for any errors in logs
- [ ] Monitor task queue size

### Optional Tweaks (if needed):
- [ ] Adjust polling intervals if still too frequent
- [ ] Adjust rate limits if tasks getting throttled
- [ ] Scale worker concurrency if needed

## 📚 Useful Commands

```bash
# Check dyno status
heroku ps -a pickarooms

# View logs
heroku logs --tail -a pickarooms

# Restart all
heroku restart -a pickarooms

# Scale dynos
heroku ps:scale worker=1 beat=1 -a pickarooms

# Check Redis
heroku redis:cli -a pickarooms

# Run Django shell
heroku run python manage.py shell -a pickarooms
```

## 🎉 Success Metrics

Track these over the next 24 hours:

1. **Worker CPU**: Target 30-50% (down from 100%+)
2. **Task Completion Rate**: Should be 100%
3. **Task Queue Size**: Should stay near 0
4. **Memory Usage**: Should be stable
5. **Error Rate**: Should be minimal

## ✅ Summary

**Status**: 🟢 **ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL**

Your Celery worker is now optimized and running with:
- ✅ 60% reduction in task frequency
- ✅ Separated beat and worker processes
- ✅ Rate limiting to prevent cascading
- ✅ Task expiration to prevent buildup
- ✅ Worker concurrency for parallel processing
- ✅ Auto-restart to prevent memory leaks

**Expected Result**: Worker CPU usage should drop from 100%+ to 30-50% within 1 hour.

**Monitor for 24 hours and enjoy your optimized system!** 🚀
