## TEST 1: Guest Web Check-In (Multi-Room) ‚≠ê PRIORITY

### Setup
1. Go to Django Admin ‚Üí Reservations
2. Create Reservation 1:

   - Guest Name: `John Smith`
   - Room: `Room 1`
   - Check-in: Tomorrow's date
   - Check-out: 2 days from now
   - Status: Confirmed

3. Create Reservation 2:
   - Booking Reference: `TEST123456` (SAME as above)
   - Guest Name: `John Smith`
   - Room: `Room 2` (DIFFERENT room)
   - Check-in: Tomorrow's date (SAME)
   - Check-out: 2 days from now
   - Status: Confirmed

### Test Steps
1. Open browser (incognito mode)
2. Go to `http://localhost:8000/`
3. Click "Check In Now"
4. Enter booking reference: `TEST123456`
5. Enter name: `John Smith`
6. Enter email: `test@example.com`
7. Enter phone: `+447123456789`
8. Click Continue

### Expected Results
‚úÖ System creates 1 Guest  
‚úÖ System links BOTH Reservation 1 and Reservation 2 to this Guest

‚úÖ Redirects to room_detail page  
‚úÖ Page shows multi-room section: "üè† Your Rooms"  
‚úÖ Both Room 1 and Room 2 listed  
‚úÖ Same PIN shown for all rooms  
‚úÖ Message: "The same PIN opens the front door and all your room doors"

### Verify in Admin
1. Go to Django Admin ‚Üí Guests
2. Find guest with booking ref `TEST123456`
3. Click to view details
4. Check: `front_door_pin` has a value (e.g., `1234`)
5. Go to Django Admin ‚Üí Reservations
6. Find both reservations with ref `TEST123456`
7. Verify: BOTH have `guest` linked to the SAME Guest ID

### Check Logs
```bash
# Look for these log messages:
grep "Multi-room booking detected" logs/django.log
grep "Linked reservation.*to guest" logs/django.log
grep "Generated room PIN.*for Room" logs/django.log
```

‚úÖ Same PIN for all rooms

### Verify
1. Go to All Reservations

---

## TEST 3: Admin Manual Check-In (Existing Guest) ‚≠ê CRITICAL

### Setup

---

## TEST 7: Error Handling

### Test A: Room without TTLock
1. Create 2 reservations, same booking ref
2. Assign one to a room WITH NO TTLock configured
3. Try to check in

**Expected:** Error message, rollback, no partial guest creation

### Test B: TTLock API Failure
1. Temporarily break TTLock connection (wrong credentials)
2. Try multi-room check-in

**Expected:** Error message, rollback, helpful error shown

---

## üîç DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

If something doesn't work:

### Check Database
```python
python manage.py shell
from main.models import Guest, Reservation

# Find guest
g = Guest.objects.get(reservation_number='TEST123456')
print(f"Guest: {g.full_name}, PIN: {g.front_door_pin}")

# Check reservations
reservations = g.reservations.all()
print(f"Rooms: {[r.room.name for r in reservations]}")
```

### Check Logs
```bash
# Django logs
tail -f logs/django.log | grep -i "multi-room"

# Celery logs (if applicable)
tail -f logs/celery.log
```

### Check View Response
Look in Django admin logs or console for:
- `Multi-room booking detected: X rooms linked`
- `Generated room PIN {pin} for {room_name}`
- `Linked reservation {id} to guest {guest_id}`

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Only 1 room shown on room_detail page"
- Check: Is `is_multiroom` being passed to template?
- Check: Does `guest.reservations.count()` return > 1?

**Issue:** "Database error: duplicate key"
- Check: Did migration 0033 run? `python manage.py showmigrations main`

**Issue:** "PIN doesn't work on second room"
- Check: Was PIN generated for that room's lock?
- Check logs for `Generated room PIN` for that specific room

## üìä TEST MATRIX

## üöÄ AFTER TESTING LOCALLY

Once all tests pass:

1. Commit changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Multi-room booking implementation - tested and verified"
```

2. Deploy to production
```bash
git push heroku main
heroku run python manage.py migrate -a pickarooms
```

3. Run same tests on production with real data
4. Monitor logs for 24 hours
```bash
heroku logs --tail -a pickarooms | grep -i "multi-room"
```
