---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Run the Nuclear Reset Command
```bash
heroku run python manage.py nuclear_reset_reservations
```

When prompted, type exactly: `DELETE ALL`

### Step 2: Re-sync iCal Feeds
1. Go to Django Admin → iCal Sync
2. Click "Sync All iCal Feeds"
3. Wait for sync to complete
4. This will create clean reservation data from scratch

### Step 3: Upload XLS File
1. Go to Django Admin → Upload XLS
2. Upload your enrichment file
3. XLS should now correctly enrich CONFIRMED reservations (not cancelled)

### Step 4: Verify
1. Check "Today's Guests" page
2. Verify that confirmed reservations are enriched with guest details
3. Verify that cancelled reservations remain unenriched

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **This command deletes ALL reservations** - there is no undo
- **Double confirmation required:** You must type "DELETE ALL" exactly
- **After deletion:** Database will be empty - you MUST re-sync iCal feeds
- **Root cause:** Production database had corrupted/stale data causing XLS to match wrong reservations
- **Expected outcome:** After fresh sync + XLS upload, production should behave like local environment

---

## 📊 Current Production State (Before Reset)

- **Confirmed reservations:** 166 (unenriched)
- **Cancelled reservations:** 154 (some enriched - incorrect)
- **Problem:** XLS enriching cancelled instead of confirmed

---

## 🎯 Expected State (After Reset)

- **All reservations:** 0 (deleted)
- **After iCal sync:** Clean confirmed + cancelled reservations
- **After XLS upload:** Confirmed reservations enriched, cancelled unenriched
