# Price Suggester - Complete System Overhaul
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready

---

## 🎯 Problems Identified & Fixed

### 1. ❌ Missing Events (Only 182 of 600+ available)
**Problem:** API only fetching first page (200 events max)  
**Root Cause:** No pagination, limited date range  
**Solution:**
- Implemented multi-page pagination (up to 50 pages)
- Query by venue ID for priority venues (Co-op Live, AO Arena, Etihad, Warehouse)
- Removed end date limit to capture all future events

**Results:**
- **Before:** 182 events, ending Nov 2025
- **After:** 622 events, extending to Jan 2027
- Co-op Live: 7 → **138 events**
- AO Arena: 15 → **74 events**

---

### 2. ❌ No Email Alerts (Only SMS configured)
**Problem:** Only SMS alerts configured, no email with full details  
**Solution:**
- Added dual alert system: Email (full details) + SMS (simple list)
- Email: Unlimited, full event information with pricing and links
- SMS: Max 10/day, simple format with dates and venue shortcuts

---

### 3. ❌ Duplicate Alerts (No Smart Comparison)
**Problem:** No tracking of which events are NEW vs existing  
**Root Cause:** System couldn't distinguish between new events and updates  
**Solution:**
```python
# Before polling: Capture existing event_ids
existing_event_ids = set(PopularEvent.objects.values_list('event_id', flat=True))

# During polling: Track fetched event_ids
polled_event_ids = set()

# Smart comparison: Only alert on TRULY NEW events
truly_new = polled_event_ids - existing_event_ids
```

**Results:** Zero duplicate alerts, only NEW events trigger notifications

---

### 4. ❌ Poor Popularity Scoring
**Problem:** Duran Duran at Co-op Live scoring 45 (GREEN/Low) instead of HIGH  
**Root Cause:** Events without ticket pricing weren't scored appropriately  
**Solution:**
```python
# New Scoring Algorithm:
Base: 15 points
Sold out: +50
Ticket price tiers: +5 to +35
Venue importance:
  - Warehouse Project: +50 (always premium)
  - Co-op/AO/Etihad: +40 (tier 1)
  - Other major venues: +25 (tier 2)
BONUS: +15 for missing price at major venue (assume premium)
```

**Results:** All Co-op Live/AO Arena events now score 70 (HIGH/Orange)

---

### 5. ❌ UI Issues
**Problems:**
- Search form inputs misaligned
- No visible link to event detail pages
- Calendar view broken
- Page scrolling to top on toggle

**Solutions:**
- Fixed search form with flexbox layout
- Added prominent "📋 View Full Details" button on each event
- Removed calendar view, replaced with Priority Venues toggle
- Added anchor links to prevent scroll-to-top

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Query Strategy
```python
# Priority venue IDs
venues = [
    'KovZ9177z1f',  # Co-op Live
    'Z7r9jZaAWw',   # AO Arena
    'KovZpZAnJ6AA', # Etihad Stadium
    'KovZ9177TpV',  # Warehouse Project
]

# Query each venue separately (gets ALL events)
for venue_id in venues:
    fetch_all_pages(venueId=venue_id)

# Also query general Manchester (catches other venues)
fetch_all_pages(city='Manchester')
```

### Smart Alert Logic
```python
def check_new_important_events(new_event_ids):
    # Only process events in new_event_ids list
    # These are confirmed NEW by comparison in poll task
    
    events = PopularEvent.objects.filter(
        id__in=new_event_ids,
        sms_sent=False
    )
    
    # Send email with full details
    send_email_alert(events)
    
    # Send SMS with simple list (if under daily limit)
    if not exceeded_sms_limit():
        send_sms_alert(events)
```
