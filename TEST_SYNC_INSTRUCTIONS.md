# ✅ SYNC NOW BUTTON - TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

## Status: Import Working ✅
The import has been verified and works correctly.

## How to Test:

### 1. Restart Django Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
python manage.py runserver
```

### 2. Access Admin Panel
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
```

### 3. Navigate to iCal Configs
- Go to: **Main → Room ical configs**

### 4. Enable Syncing
- Click on your room (e.g., "Room 1")
- Make sure:
  - ✅ **Booking active** is checked
  - ✅ **Booking ical url** is filled in
- Click "Save"

### 5. Test Manual Sync
- Go back to Room iCal configs list
- Select the checkbox next to your room
- In the "Action" dropdown, select: **"Sync selected rooms now (immediate)"**
- Click **"Go"**

### 6. Expected Result
You should see a green success message like:
```
Sync complete: 5 created, 2 updated, 1 cancelled. Errors: 0
```

### 7. Verify Reservations Created
- Go to: **Main → Reservations**
- You should see new confirmed reservations

## 🔍 If It Doesn't Work:

### Check the error message shown in admin
### Check Django console output for detailed logs
### Make sure iCal URL is valid (test it in browser)

## 📝 What Changed:
- `sync_now` admin action now calls `sync_reservations_for_room()` directly
- No Celery/Docker needed for manual sync
- Runs immediately and shows results

## 🎯 Next Step After Sync:
Once you have confirmed reservations from iCal sync, upload your XLS file to enrich them with guest details.
