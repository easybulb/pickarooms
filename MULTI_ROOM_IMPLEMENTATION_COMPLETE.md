# MULTI-ROOM BOOKING IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE ✅

## 📋 SUMMARY

Implemented full multi-room booking support where:
- **ONE guest** can book **MULTIPLE rooms**
- **ONE PIN** works for **front door + all room doors**
- **All rooms shown** on guest's room_detail page
- Proper handling in **ALL check-in flows**

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

### Phase 1: Database Schema ✅
**File:** `main/models.py`

Changed:
```python
# BEFORE
guest = models.OneToOneField(Guest, ..., related_name='reservation')

# AFTER  
guest = models.ForeignKey(Guest, ..., related_name='reservations')
```

**Result:** One guest can now be linked to multiple reservations.

**Migration:** `0033_alter_reservation_guest.py` created and run locally ✅

---

### Phase 2: Guest Web Check-In Flow ✅
**File:** `main/views.py` - `enrich_reservation()` (line ~392)

**Changes:**
1. Finds ALL reservations with same booking reference
2. Creates ONE guest
3. Links ALL reservations to that guest
4. Generates PINs for ALL room doors (same PIN for all)

**Code added:**
```python
# Find ALL reservations with same booking reference
all_reservations = Reservation.objects.filter(
    booking_reference=reservation.booking_reference,
    status='confirmed',
    guest__isnull=True
).select_related('room')

# Link ALL to guest
for res in all_reservations:
    res.guest = guest
    res.save()

# Generate PINs for ALL rooms
for res in all_reservations:
    if res.room.ttlock:
        # Generate same PIN on this room's lock
        room_response = client.generate_temporary_pin(...)
```

---

### Phase 3: Admin Manual Check-In Flow ✅
**File:** `main/views.py` - `manual_checkin_reservation()` (line ~1746)

**Scenario A: Existing Guest Found**
- Links reservation to existing guest ✅
- **NEW:** Generates PIN for the additional room ✅
- Uses existing guest's PIN ✅

**Scenario B: Creating New Guest**
- Finds ALL reservations with same booking ref ✅
- Creates ONE guest ✅
- Links ALL reservations to guest ✅
- Generates PINs for ALL rooms ✅

**Code added:**
```python
if existing_guest:
    # Link reservation
    reservation.guest = existing_guest
    reservation.save()
    
    # NEW: Generate PIN for additional room
    ttlock_client = TTLockClient()
    room_response = ttlock_client.generate_temporary_pin(
        lock_id=reservation.room.ttlock.lock_id,
        pin=existing_guest.front_door_pin,  # Use existing PIN
        ...
    )
else:
    # Find all reservations
    all_reservations = Reservation.objects.filter(
        booking_reference=reservation.booking_reference,
        ...
    )
    
    # Generate PINs for ALL rooms
    for res in all_reservations:
        ttlock_client.generate_temporary_pin(...)
    
    # Link ALL reservations
    for res in all_reservations:
        res.guest = guest
        res.save()
```

---

### Phase 4: Room Detail Page Updates ✅
**File:** `main/views.py` - `room_detail()` (line ~628)

**Changes:**
```python
# Get all reservations for this guest
guest_reservations = guest.reservations.all().select_related('room')
is_multiroom = guest_reservations.count() > 1

# Build list of rooms
guest_rooms = []
for res in guest_reservations:
    guest_rooms.append({
        'room': res.room,
        'reservation': res,
        'check_in': res.check_in_date,
        'check_out': res.check_out_date,
    })

# Pass to template
context = {
    ...
    'guest_rooms': guest_rooms,
    'is_multiroom': is_multiroom,
}
```

**File:** `main/templates/main/room_detail.html`

**Added multi-room section:**
```html
{% if is_multiroom and show_pin %}
<div class="multi-room-section">
    <h2>🏠 Your Rooms</h2>
    <p>You have booked multiple rooms. Your PIN works for all of them!</p>
    <div style="display: grid...">
        {% for room_info in guest_rooms %}
        <div class="room-card">
            <h3>{{ room_info.room.name }}</h3>
            <p>📅 Check-in: {{ room_info.check_in|date:"d M Y" }}</p>
            <p>📅 Check-out: {{ room_info.check_out|date:"d M Y" }}</p>
            <p>🔑 PIN: {{ front_door_pin }}#</p>
        </div>
        {% endfor %}
    </div>
    <p>✨ The same PIN opens the front door and all your room doors.</p>
</div>
{% endif %}
```

## 🔑 PIN STRATEGY

**ONE PIN for everything:**
- Front door: `1234`
- Room 1 door: `1234`
- Room 2 door: `1234`
- Room 3 door: `1234`

The **same PIN** is registered on **multiple lock IDs** in the TTLock system.

**Storage:**
- `Guest.front_door_pin` = "1234" (the actual PIN)
- `Guest.front_door_pin_id` = Keyboard password ID for front door lock
- `Guest.room_pin_id` = Keyboard password ID for first room (for backward compatibility)

Each room lock has its own keyboard password ID in TTLock, but all use the same PIN digits.

## 📊 USER EXPERIENCE FLOW

### Scenario: Guest books Room 1 + Room 2

**Step 1: Guest enters booking reference on web**
```
System finds:
- Reservation 1: Room 1, check-in 20 Dec
- Reservation 2: Room 2, check-in 20 Dec
- Both have booking_reference = "1234567890"
```

**Step 2: Guest provides name, email, phone**
```
System creates:
- 1 Guest record (booking_reference = "1234567890")
- Links BOTH Reservation 1 and Reservation 2 to this Guest
```

**Step 3: System generates PINs**
```
1. Generate PIN: 1234
2. Register on front door lock → PIN ID: ABC123
3. Register on Room 1 lock → PIN ID: DEF456  
4. Register on Room 2 lock → PIN ID: GHI789
```

**Step 4: Guest sees room_detail page**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Your Access PIN: 1234#              │
│ Works for front door & all rooms    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🏠 Your Rooms                       │
│ You have booked multiple rooms.     │
│                                     │
│ ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐ │
│ │ Room 1       │  │ Room 2       │ │
│ │ Check-in: 20 │  │ Check-in: 20 │ │
│ │ Check-out: 22│  │ Check-out: 22│ │
│ │ PIN: 1234#   │  │ PIN: 1234#   │ │
│ └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘ │
│                                     │
│ ✨ Same PIN opens front door and   │
│    all your room doors.             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🎯 WHAT PROBLEM DOES THIS SOLVE?

### Before:
```
❌ Guest books Room 1 + Room 2
❌ Admin checks in Room 1 → Guest created ✅
❌ Admin checks in Room 2 → DATABASE ERROR: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"
❌ Guest only has access to Room 1
❌ Room 2 remains unenriched
```

### After:
```
✅ Guest books Room 1 + Room 2
✅ Admin checks in Room 1 → Guest created, PIN generated for Room 1 ✅
✅ Admin checks in Room 2 → Links to existing guest, PIN generated for Room 2 ✅
✅ Guest has access to BOTH rooms with SAME PIN
✅ room_detail page shows BOTH rooms
✅ Same PIN works on front door + Room 1 + Room 2
```

## 📝 NOTES

1. **Single PIN Strategy:** We use ONE PIN for all locks. This is simpler for guests and matches the template message "Works for BOTH front door & room door".

2. **Backward Compatibility:** Single-room bookings work exactly as before. No changes to their flow.

3. **Guest.room_pin_id:** Still stores only ONE PIN ID (first room) for backward compatibility, but all rooms get PINs registered.

4. **Error Handling:** If any room PIN generation fails, the system rolls back ALL PINs and deletes the guest.

5. **Logging:** Comprehensive logging added for debugging multi-room scenarios.

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**  
**Date:** January 27, 2025
