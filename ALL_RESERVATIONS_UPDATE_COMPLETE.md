## Changes Implemented

### 1. View Logic Updated (`main/views.py`)

**DEFAULT VIEW NOW SHOWS:**
- ✅ Current guests (currently staying)
- ✅ Upcoming reservations (future check-ins)
- ✅ Recently checked out (last 1 day only) - for review message handling
- ❌ Old past reservations (filtered out by default)

**SEARCH MODE:**
- When user searches (booking ref or guest name)
- Shows ALL reservations matching search (no date filter)
- Allows finding any reservation regardless of date

**SHOW ALL MODE:**
- Button to toggle "Show All (Including Old)" 
- Query parameter: `?show_all=true`
- Shows everything when needed

**Query Logic:**
```python
# DEFAULT VIEW
reservations = Reservation.objects.filter(
    Q(check_out_date__gte=yesterday) |  # Currently staying OR checked out in last 1 day
    Q(check_in_date__gte=today)  # OR checking in today or future
)

# SEARCH MODE (overrides default)
if search_query:
    reservations = Reservation.objects.all()  # No date filter
    reservations = reservations.filter(
        Q(booking_reference__icontains=search_query) |
        Q(guest_name__icontains=search_query) |
        Q(guest__full_name__icontains=search_query)
    )
```

## How It Works

### Default View (No Filters)
```
User visits: /admin-page/all-reservations/

Backend filters:
- check_out_date >= yesterday (still here or just left)
- OR check_in_date >= today (arriving soon)

Result: Shows ~10-50 relevant reservations
```

### Search Mode
```
User searches: "6623478393"

Backend:
- Searches ALL reservations (no date filter)
- Matches booking_reference, guest_name, or guest.full_name

Result: Shows matching reservations from any date
```

### Show All Mode
```
User clicks: "Show All (Including Old)"

Backend:
- Shows ALL reservations (no filters)
- Ordered by check_in_date

Result: Shows hundreds of reservations (including old)
```
