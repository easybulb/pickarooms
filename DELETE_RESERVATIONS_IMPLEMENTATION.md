# Delete Reservations Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added individual and bulk delete functionality for reservations at `/admin-page/all-reservations/`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend (main/views.py)
Added two new view functions:

#### `delete_reservation(request, reservation_id)`
- **URL**: `/admin-page/delete-reservation/<id>/`
- **Permission**: `main.delete_guest`
- **Functionality**:
  - Deletes individual unenriched reservation
  - Prevents deletion of enriched reservations (linked to guests)
  - Logs deletion in AuditLog
  - Shows success/error messages

#### `bulk_delete_reservations(request)`
- **URL**: `/admin-page/bulk-delete-reservations/`
- **Permission**: `main.delete_guest`
- **Functionality**:
  - Deletes multiple unenriched reservations at once
  - Automatically skips enriched reservations
  - Provides detailed feedback (deleted count, skipped count)
  - Logs each deletion in AuditLog

### 2. URL Routes (main/urls.py)
Added two new URL patterns:
```python
path('admin-page/delete-reservation/<int:reservation_id>/', views.delete_reservation, name='delete_reservation'),
path('admin-page/bulk-delete-reservations/', views.bulk_delete_reservations, name='bulk_delete_reservations'),
```

### 3. Frontend (main/templates/main/all_reservations.html)

#### UI Additions:
1. **Checkbox Column**: Added to table header and each row
   - Only unenriched reservations have selectable checkboxes
   - Enriched reservations show "â€”" (disabled)

2. **Bulk Actions Bar**:
   - Shows selection count
   - "Select All" button (all pages)
   - "Deselect All" button
   - "Delete Selected" button (red danger button)
   - Hidden by default, appears when selections are made

3. **Individual Delete Button**:
   - Appears in Actions column for unenriched reservations
   - Inline form with confirmation dialog
   - Red "Delete" button

#### JavaScript Features:
- Checkbox selection tracking across paginated pages
- Dynamic UI updates (count, button states)
- Header checkbox for page-level select/deselect
- Confirmation dialogs for delete actions
- Form submission with selected IDs

### 4. Styling
Added CSS for:
- Bulk actions bar (yellow warning background)
- Delete buttons (red danger styling)
- Checkbox styling (18x18px, pointer cursor)
- Selection controls
- Disabled states

## User Flow

### Individual Delete:
1. Navigate to "All Reservations" page
2. Find unenriched reservation
3. Click red "Delete" button in Actions column
4. Confirm in dialog
5. Reservation deleted, success message shown

### Bulk Delete:
1. Navigate to "All Reservations" page
2. Check boxes next to unenriched reservations
3. Bulk actions bar appears showing count
4. Click "Delete Selected" button
5. Confirm in dialog
6. Selected reservations deleted
7. Success message shows: "Successfully deleted X reservation(s)"
8. If any enriched were selected: "Skipped Y enriched reservation(s)"

## Safety Features

1. **Permission Control**: Only users with `main.delete_guest` permission can delete
2. **Enriched Protection**: Cannot delete reservations linked to guests
3. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Both individual and bulk deletes require confirmation
4. **Audit Logging**: All deletions logged with user, timestamp, and details
5. **Visual Indicators**: Enriched reservations clearly marked and non-selectable
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing reservations or errors

## Technical Notes

- Bulk delete processes reservations one-by-one (atomic operations)
- Failed deletions don't stop the entire batch
- Pagination-aware: can select across multiple pages
- CSRF protection on all POST requests
- Database transactions ensure data integrity

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Individual delete works for unenriched reservations
- [ ] Individual delete blocked for enriched reservations
- [ ] Bulk delete works across multiple pages
- [ ] Bulk delete skips enriched reservations
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs appear
- [ ] Success/error messages display correctly
- [ ] Audit logs created for each deletion
- [ ] Permission enforcement works (non-staff users blocked)
- [ ] UI updates correctly after deletions
- [ ] Pagination still works after deletions

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add "Undo" functionality with soft deletes
2. Export selected reservations before deleting
3. Filter by deletable (unenriched only) option
4. Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Shift+Click for range selection)
5. Drag-to-select checkboxes
