However, after booking, I received a message stating that parking wasn't guaranteed. I contacted the host, who assured me they would reserve a spot for me. When I arrived, I discovered that the parking space was not a proper designated area but rather on a lawn next to the property. I'm not sure if this was private or public land. Fortunately, I didn't receive a ticket.

Please be aware that although the description states, ""The family room features a washing machine, a dining area...well-equipped kitchen..."" with corresponding photos under the room details.  It turns out the dining area and the kitchen is actually shared with three other rooms (more than 10 people sharing a small kitchen with a dining table for four?).

As for the kitchen and dining area, the listing clearly states that the house is shared with private rooms, meaning the kitchen and dining space are communal. I'm sorry if this wasn't clear, and I understand how this might have impacted your plans.

Decent sized kitchen, living area, and the bathroom was so nice, too. Henry mentioned that he is going to install a TV in the single room eventually (which didn't bother me not having one as I don't watch much TV anyway). He is doing some upgrading to one of the other rooms to make it even more perfect, which is exciting.

There is a small dairy (or corner shop) a 4-minute walk away, so easy if you need a snack or a drink. Loved the location - easy walk to the train station (27 minutes), 4-minute Uber to Co-Op Live if you don't want to walk the 30 minutes there. The single room was small, but it was just what I needed! Thank you so much, Henry, for such a lovely stay and for sorting out the other guests who were making a lot of noise. That was really well appreciated :)","Just the noise of the guests upstairs on the second night. However, this is down to guest behaviour, nothing to do with the host or the house at all!

Only £5 in a taxi to Manchester piccadilly train station.
On arrival I was met by the owner shown the kitchen. Clean spacious and has just what you need plus more ! I was in need of a hot drink and there was tea coffee milk etc all there. And a fridge for me to keep my chilled food and my drinks. 
The room was lovely. Bright clean and comfortable. Just what we needed for a.night away. There was plenty of electric plugs and a fan! There was a window for.light and fresh air. The TV had everything signed into so had netflix ready! WiFi was excellent and had already given me the password. Bathroom was shared with 1 other room however we had no issues and we were aware of this when we booked. The owner was very helpful and onsite for any queries  and questions we had. The room door locks for safety and we had a fab night at the coop live which was a 20 minute walk away. There was a chippy on the way aswell. Check in is from2 and check out between 10 and 11 so Fantastic times !

Any talk me and my friends had he would come knock on our room and tell us to be quiet, it was really disturbing and actually got us quite frantic. At 12:30 AM he complained again and I kid you not we were simply talking, with a normal tone of voice. How can this be something to complain about? At that stage we had enough and decided to leave. At 1 am Upon talking, packing and leaving he then opened his room door again and shouted ‘do you guys not plan on sleeping’ to which I rudely responded we’re leaving. But this is the thing, so what if we didn’t plan on sleeping? I’ve paid for a room does it mean I have to be in bed and sleep by 11 PM? Why Does this guy have a say on when I should sleep.

Thank you for your feedback. I’m sorry to hear that your experience did not meet your expectations. However, I’d like to clarify a few points to provide some context. The property is listed as a quiet, comfortable space for guests to rest and is not intended for parties, as stated in the listing.

During your stay, the noise level, loud music, and activities were disturbing other guests. Additionally, smoking, including marijuana, is strictly prohibited on the property for the comfort and safety of all guests. I had to address these issues multiple times to ensure a peaceful environment for everyone.

I understand your frustration, but I have to prioritize the experience of all guests. I hope you can understand the need to maintain a respectful and quiet atmosphere.
